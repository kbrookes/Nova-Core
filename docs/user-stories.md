# User Stories for Nova Core Plugin

## Developers
- As a developer, I want to avoid duplicating core functions across Nova sites, so I can make updates centrally and propagate them via Git Updater.
- As a developer, I want to enqueue structured tracking scripts with correct mode (Zaraz, GA, Plausible) without writing custom code for each site.

## Site Admins
- As a site admin, I want to enable or disable modules (CPTs, tracking, ACF groups) via the admin interface without developer help.

## Marketers
- As a marketer, I want analytics events that clearly show the page name, section, and click label so I can understand user engagement.

## Content Editors
- As a content editor, I want all the correct ACF fields to be available for Services, Page Types, and Resources after plugin activation.

## Designers
- As a designer, I want clean separation between layout (theme) and logic (plugin) to keep projects maintainable.
